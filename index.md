## About me

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm **Jhanvi Zala**,I’m a Software Engineer and Machine Learning Specialist with 3+ years of experience in cloud-native API development, full-stack systems, and advanced AI solutions. I specialize in:

- Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI
- Multilingual TTS and VITS architectures
- ML pipelines, model optimization, and MLOps
- Scalable deployments on GCP, Azure AKS, and Kubernetes

I’ve worked across diverse domains including document automation, speech synthesis, and image segmentation, blending engineering and research to deliver impactful AI products.

Explore some of my best work — both from industry and my own experiments.
