## Professional Experience


**Role:** Software Engineer  
**Company:** eInfochips Pvt Ltd., Ahmedabad,Gujarat, India  
**Duration:** June 2019- July 2022

In my three years of experience I have worked of various backend Technologies, Lets explore a few.

### Webportal for Multischool Education
Project goal :Initially I have worked as Backend Engineering learning the technology stack of Javascript- Nodejs and Mysql database. This was a school webportal which handles records of schools, students, techears and extra curricular syllabus. Similar project with few modification was also part of experince which handled the records of pharmaceutical company. This includes employes, products and industrail machinery records. 

My role - In this case I redefined the whole mysql architecture of 100 different tables. This involved handling missing value, inconsistent data type in whole strture, various connection keys and created the  This entitled me to create Various complex procedure for and views and optimize the data retrivel part. I took the liberty of Nodejs to create RestApis services. The Frontend technology utilized Angular. 

Tech Stack:
Nodejs,Javascript, CI/CD, Mysql, Angualar, JIRA,, Jenkins, Github

### Desptop App Verification
Project goal : The client required automation framework which could test and verify their desktop application. This application was an interactive platform for any four wheel vehicle music system analysis. The verification included UI test, Log retrivel analysis, remote control system verification and analytical report anaylsis.

My role : I was the lead developer of this project right from gathering requirement information. Along with  I aslo draft the test cases documents for differents component which comprised of around 60 cases. Document Design for the framework architecture and Actual Framework Design considering different modules of the Project. The tech stack used whre Nodejs/Javascript, Jest framework and Selenium. A complex structur for log verification was adopted using an ML model like spacy to verify the receivable entieties at different module level of the code. The graphical view require mathematical module to be developes to check the plots and values  and UI verification was handled by Selenium. Everthing was compresses with NodeJs Jest Framework.

Tech Stack : Nodejs,Jest Framework, Selenium, Github,Jenkins, Excell sheets, Confluence, Kanban boards

### Linux based Component Developement and Harware Verification

Project Goal : This is was an new modular soundbar to existing family os musical gadgets. The client used to sell the musical gadgets like speakers,soundbars, headphones earplugs and more ; all equiped with smart technology like alexa, google assistant and siri. The goal was to develop the software component and verify the hardware and software system thoroughly.

My role: The new soundbar model required the new software update component and for  the development of this component I mostly used linux and CPP scripts to be able to run it on their light weight os. The I developed as complex architecture, which needs to be integrated into previous whole framework. This extends to code reusability, module compression techniques, UI to app interactive services, gadget to gadget communication and much more. The second part Of this where the automation testing where existing based framework need to be configured for the new system. This framework was mostly developed in python, pytest and linux for a thorough testing. Debugging, modification, error reporting and code fixing are the expertise where I shine.
